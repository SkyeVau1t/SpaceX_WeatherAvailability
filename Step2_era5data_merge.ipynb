    "# Notebook 2: ERA5 Reanalysis Download and Launch-Time Weather Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "This notebook retrieves and processes **ERA5 reanalysis data** in order to\n",
    "characterize the atmospheric and marine conditions present at the time of each\n",
    "SpaceX launch from Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal is to construct a physically meaningful, launch-aligned weather\n",
    "dataset that can be used for machine learning analysis in subsequent notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data sources\n",
    "This notebook uses the following datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ERA5 single-level atmospheric reanalysis** (ECMWF)\n",
    "  - 10 m wind components\n",
    "  - 2 m temperature\n",
    "  - Total cloud cover\n",
    "  - Precipitation fields\n",
    "  - Mean sea-level pressure\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ERA5 wave reanalysis**\n",
    "  - Significant wave height at an offshore point\n",
    "  - Used as a proxy for booster recovery and landing constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SpaceX launch timestamps**\n",
    "  - Produced in Notebook 1\n",
    "  - Used to select the exact launch hour from ERA5\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Temporal and spatial alignment\n",
    "ERA5 data are retrieved at **hourly resolution** and spatially subset to a small\n",
    "region around Kennedy Space Center. For each launch:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The launch time is floored to the nearest hour\n",
    "- The nearest ERA5 grid point to KSC is selected\n",
    "- Offshore wave conditions are sampled at a representative ocean location\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach balances physical realism with computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical considerations\n",
    "Because ERA5 files retrieved through the CDS API may be delivered as compressed\n",
    "archives, this notebook includes logic to:\n",
    "- Detect ZIP-compressed files masquerading as NetCDF\n",
    "- Safely extract and clean the data before ingestion\n",
    "- Concatenate monthly files into continuous time series\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps ensure robust, reproducible data ingestion on local machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature construction\n",
    "From the merged ERA5 datasets, the following launch-time features are constructed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 10 m wind speed (from u/v components)\n",
    "- 2 m air temperature (converted to °C)\n",
    "- Total cloud cover (fraction)\n",
    "- Total and convective precipitation rates\n",
    "- Mean sea-level pressure\n",
    "- Significant wave height\n",
    "\n",
    "All features are aligned exactly to the launch hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "The final output of this notebook is a cleaned, merged dataset containing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One row per SpaceX launch\n",
    "- Launch metadata\n",
    "- Corresponding atmospheric and marine conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset serves as the primary input for:\n",
    "- Weather scrub identification (Notebook 3)\n",
    "- Machine learning inference of launch constraints (Notebook 4)\n",
    "- Forecast-based launch confidence estimation (Notebook 5)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "- ERA5 represents a physically consistent reanalysis, not the exact forecast used\n",
    "  operationally at the time of launch.\n",
    "- Spatial averaging may smooth localized effects (e.g., convective cells).\n",
    "- Offshore wave conditions are approximated using a single representative point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these limitations, ERA5 provides a high-quality, physically consistent\n",
    "baseline for learning historical launch-weather relationships.\n"
