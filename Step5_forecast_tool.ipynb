    "# Notebook 5: Forecast-Based Launch Weather Confidence (Severity / Near-Envelope)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What this notebook does\n",
    "This notebook turns the **severity-based near-envelope classifier** (trained in Notebook 4 and saved as a `.joblib` pipeline) into a user-facing forecast tool. A user provides a proposed launch datetime and rocket family, and the tool returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **P(near-envelope):** probability that forecast conditions resemble the most restrictive historical launch conditions (top-tail by severity proxy)\n",
    "- **Weather confidence:** `1 − P(near-envelope)` interpreted as the chance conditions remain within the historically demonstrated envelope\n",
    "- An **audit log** of any datetime snapping applied (past / outside forecast horizon)\n",
    "- The **exact features used** for inference (for reproducibility)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **weather-risk screening tool**, not a definitive “SpaceX will/won’t launch” classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Forecast data sources (operational inference)\n",
    "Two forecast time series are fetched at hourly resolution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ECMWF-based atmospheric forecast** (Open-Meteo ECMWF endpoint) at the KSC point:\n",
    "   - `wind_speed_10m`, `temperature_2m`, `cloud_cover`, `precipitation`, `pressure_msl`\n",
    "2. **Marine wave forecast** (Open-Meteo Marine endpoint) at an offshore point:\n",
    "   - `wave_height` (proxy for recovery/landing sea-state constraints)\n",
    "\n",
    "All times are handled as **UTC** and aligned to the **hour**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature engineering (forecast → training schema)\n",
    "Forecast variables are mapped into the same model feature schema used in training:\n",
    "- `wind_speed_10m` (m/s)\n",
    "- `t2m_C` (°C)\n",
    "- `tcc_frac` (cloud cover fraction = % / 100)\n",
    "- `tp_mmhr` (precipitation rate in mm/hr as provided by the API)\n",
    "- `msl` (mean sea-level pressure converted hPa → Pa by multiplying by 100)\n",
    "- `swh` (significant wave height proxy from marine `wave_height`, meters)\n",
    "- time-derived features: `launch_hour`, `launch_month`, `season`\n",
    "- metadata feature: `rocket_name`\n",
    "\n",
    "Because convective precipitation is not available through this lightweight API path, `cp_mmhr` is set to `0.0`. This is acceptable for the demo because it was not a dominant driver in the trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datetime validation (snapping with transparency)\n",
    "Forecast horizons are limited. If a user requests a datetime:\n",
    "- in the past (or too close to “now”), it is snapped to the next forecast hour\n",
    "- too far beyond the forecast horizon, it is snapped back to the last available forecast hour\n",
    "- snapping actions are recorded in `messages` and returned to the user\n",
    "\n",
    "This preserves usability while keeping the inference process explicit and auditable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpreting the output\n",
    "The model predicts **P(near-envelope)** (risk of being in the high-severity tail). We report:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weather confidence (within historical envelope)** = `1 − P(near-envelope)`\n",
    "- A simple qualitative bucket:\n",
    "  - GREEN: low near-envelope risk\n",
    "  - YELLOW: moderate near-envelope risk\n",
    "  - RED: high near-envelope risk\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations (what this does NOT claim)\n",
    "- This tool does not model range safety, vehicle technical status, pad availability, or mission/trajectory-specific constraints.\n",
    "- The “near-envelope” definition is derived from historical launch conditions, not official LCC thresholds.\n",
    "- Forecast variables are close proxies for training variables but not guaranteed to be identical across data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these constraints, this notebook demonstrates an end-to-end **forecast ingestion → feature engineering → ML inference → user-facing confidence** workflow.\n"
